# Project - Portfolio Landing Page

This is a project to learn and improve HTML and CSS skills to follow a path of Front End Development.

It follows a simple template of a portfolio's home page with interactive buttons. 
These buttons have been seperated into 3 categories:

## 1. Menu choices:

On the top right of the landing page, 5 options have been added to allow user to pick another page to view. 
These options are; 

~Home: This is the landing page that is currently open.

~About: This is a different page that has more details about the owner of the portfolio (Not complete since this is currently a landing page example.)

~Skills: This page will list the skills that have been acquared by studying, hands-on, or self-taught. (Not complete since this is currently a landing page example.)

This options have been given a transform effect through CSS to move up when the mouse is hovering on them.
